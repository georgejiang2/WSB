Thought maybe SLV would catch up to GLD but it didn\u2019t and I cut my losses quick on that position.\n\nI continue to think options sellers are underestimating the implied volatility next week.\n\nGood luck to everyone out there.  If you want to succeed at this game, you have to put in the work.  There are no shortcuts.",

From military industrial, to domestic infrastructure,  computer chips, vehicles, batteries, other electrical components, all dependent on minerals. \n\n\nFor everyone else who\u2019s interested, the short term play(s) will be now, and on Monday. The executive order signed last week on Thursday 3/20/25 states 10 days after the date of the order, a list will be composed of current domestic mineral \u201cproducers\u201d with operations to be expedited in any permits required to continue operations/ increase or start new operations. \n\nPersonally, my watchlist is comprised mostly of pennystocks due to the nature of the current industry. What I mean by this is generally speaking we as a country (USA) have outsourced much of the industrialization of the modern world to other countries with cheaper exports. Yes there are domestic producers that are larger, I\u2019m somewhat weary of the performance of these in the longer term. \n\nTo preface, I currently hold no positions as of yet, however last Friday 2/21/25 to last Monday 2/24/25 I scalped a pennystock (that I\u2019m not allowed to name) based on the EO news.\n\nThe only domestic non pennystock on my list is BHP, an elderly company that has the infrastructure to produce already. I\u2019m not holding currently due to lacker performance as well as looking to not make a play until the list comes out on Sunday. The other play I\u2019ve made is GGN which isn\u2019t domestic, but still a hedge as tariffs could generally increase the price of gold anyways as it already has for copper. And GGN pays a sweet dividend. \n\nIf anyone is interested in the mining watchlist I\u2019ll be playing, just look up domestic lithium, the pebble property (largest known copper deposit), or look up battery grade graphite. These are all separate operations fyi. \n\nI\u2019ve done DD but all of my favorite picks are literally pennystocks for the short term. And yet again, asides from BHP, pennystocks dependent on the executive order handing out permits to start production. \n\nAnyone who has some insight + non pennystock tickers feel free to comment. Thanks \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So this might sound ridiculous \u2014 I\u2019ve been thinking about a slightly off the beaten path investing idea and wanted to get some feedback.\n\nI\u2019ve got two pets, and we don\u2019t currently have pet insurance for them. I\u2019ve done a bit of research on Trupanion (TRUP), and while I\u2019m still on the fence about their policies (they seem to up your rate regularly but that feels like it happens across the pet insurance industry annually)\u2026 I was wondering about a different approach: what if I just bought a share of Trupanion stock every month instead of paying for a policy?\n\nRight now, their stock is trading around $38, which is not close to what a typical monthly premium might cost. My thinking is that if my pets stay healthy, I\u2019m building equity in a company that stands to benefit from more people using pet insurance (which I genuinely feel will happen over time) \u2014 kind of like a self-funded safety net that grows with the industry. Worst case, I can sell the shares if I ever do face a big vet bill.\n\nCurious if anyone else has thought this way for like a different service or product or has any perspective on this idea \u2014 either as an investing strategy or should I just get a legit pet insurance. Is this dumb as hell? A waste of time? Somewhere in between? \n\nAppreciate any insights and feedback!",

            "Yes, this is dumb as hell.\n\nIf you can afford to eat the cost of any vet bills though, you don\u2019t need insurance. Insurance is for when the bill comes, it is catastrophic to you. From an actuarial perspective if you are a good underwriting risk that means you will on average give more money to the insurance company than they will pay to cover your vet costs.\n\nAs far as your investment thesis, this makes close to zero sense. Why would you use a pet insurance company stock as a pet veterinary cost savings account/fund?",
            "People in the UK pay for pet insurance (and if not insured pay 1,000s out of pocket). Vet fees have gone through the roof in the last decade because private equity has bought out all the independent practices and given the individual vets billing targets, and because the growth of insurance has encouraged the vets to bill increased amounts \n\nIf the us is less far along this cycle shares in pet insurers may be a good bet.",

        "text": "# The Upcoming Wild Ride for Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) and My Plan to Get a Ticket\n\n[DetectiveDoot Bailing Out of QUBT During the Pinnacle of Enjoyment, Slightly Before Disaster](https://preview.redd.it/dcdjc7283cre1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af766e9ceac82d39215a2941952bb25eb383d1a)\n\n# \n\n\n\n**TLDR: This is an extremely high-risk play. I'm taking a degenerate, short-term bullish position on $QUBT and long-term short position on quantum computing stocks as a whole, with the anticipation of extremely volatile $QUBT price action soon.** \n\nCurrent Positions:\n\n\\- Short: mostly IONQ, with almost entirely put debit spreads\n\n\\- Degenerate short-term OTM calls: QUBT, rolling weekly\n\n\n\n# Quantum Companies are Bad\n\nI have returned after a couple years away to bring good tidings and some DD about a play I believe will have some extreme volatility in the coming two weeks. Over the past six or so months, quantum computing stocks have had a wild ride. Up 1200% down, [pimp slapped hard](https://qz.com/quantum-computing-stocks-nvidia-ceo-rigetti-dwave-ionq-1851771538), recovered some and currently teetering towards inevitable doom.\n\n  \nThat's right. They are all doomed. Overvalued, overhyped and **running out of steam**. You don't need me to tell you that these companies are trash. Many big names have been trashing the industry, [Martin Shkreli](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1895480382629556486) and [Kerrisdale Capital](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/investments/ionq/) being two of the most notable.\n\n# Why Do I Care about QUBT\n\nWhile all of the quantum companies have little to show for their insane valuations, QUBT is a real gem. Despite missing last quarter's disappointing earnings of -$0.47/share (est. -$0.05) they maintain a respectable market cap of \\~$1.1B while having nothing to sell. \n\n\n\n***IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THIS POST, READ THIS PARAGRAPH.*** Per the [S-8 filed 3/21/2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000101376225001115/ea0235205-s8_quantum.htm), insiders for $QUBT were recently approved to sell their shares. **Only two insiders stated immediate intent to sell stock by this coming Monday (3/31/2025).** As of 3/27/2025 only one insider has sold, with the Chairman of the Board[ Yuping Huang selling 200,000 out of his 27-million currently owned shares two days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000196858225000237/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml). The other insider expressing intent is a director who only owns 207,000 shares. **Assuming the Chairman is done selling, insider dilution shouldn't be a near-term worry, but is always possible.** Currently, [multiple firms are suing the shit](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f5ad3653710c57c&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1129US1129&sxsrf=AHTn8zpwApo4bS8d-5dXiXB8EM1N_8SZgg:1743160180622&q=qubt+lawsuit&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpmDtIGL1r84kuKz6yAcD_igefx-eKq1gCPHF3zhthFoneNn6lL83lY3KLybUMxCNDhMUtbCQQO9t_eGxoOP_s3rR9imLItfH1uBSfE1eodVtu3j9NNltXXuqTU0fP37mjBusR7Pi0GSAtMbdArRUTLOsC4dN4POVlfGKFb_2PiWfOtFnP-rmmP8j0Odsy8bbuGSebXg&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwi74uja0ayMAxUCCnkGHfJkOOIQ0pQJegQIIRAB&biw=1718&bih=1304&dpr=1) out of this company. Any insider selling this close to the unlock would just accelerate the dumpster fire. \n\nAs you can imagine, QUBT is being beaten down to oblivion. However, after scratching the surface it becomes apparent that there is ever mounting stress on QUBT short sellers. Below, I have a little spreadsheet w/ some relevant short data and some recent options flows depicting deep ITM call buying, which can be highly indicative of low liquidity.  \n\n\n|Short Interest|19%|as of 3/11/2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Cost-to-Borrow (Schwab)**|**250%+ (when available)**|**3/27/2025**|\n|**Reg SHO Threshold**|**Yes**|**???-3/27/2025 (can't download history)**|\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wx1o8ur5hcre1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c21e669f6e3413afe88f2db2182c5f8752315c6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhjgou46hcre1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6386ef702cc12b23199bba8eee25836f6143f675\n\n# Catalysts\n\nPositive News - LOL, Highly unlikely\n\nRetail Enthusiasm - Why I'm here\n\nShark Entry - Would be sick but also unlikely\n\n# My Plan\n\nThis stock is equivalent to the rides in Roller Coaster Tycoon that are designed to the idiotic launch patrons into the air, to their violent and fiery demise. My plan is to get a ticket and parachute out immediately when/if volatility climaxes. I'm being extremely risky here.\n\n# Positions\n\nNot posting my current $QUBT position as it expires today and I don't want some idiots to copy it. I am rolling later on today and I will send it to mods when I do. Posted IONQ short though, which I will roll to may OPEX next week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88yrs90z1fre1.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=99925337269c7fd2015f0b812b7293feeec38cad\n\n# Other positions\n\nShort: $SBUX\n\nLong: $COOP, $RYCEY, $OKLO covered-calls (LEAPS)\n\n",

But now, the policy risks strike us as tilted largely to the downside\n\n[In addition to Baclays, the ECB began to run warning sirens as well.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/euro-zone-banks-must-prepare-cope-with-geopolitical-shocks-ecb-warns-2025-03-27/)\n\nNow, I don\u00b4t know abou y\u00b4all, but I\u00b4m not gonna panic sell all my shares and gobble up gold and bonds (which I might soon regret...), but I have been cancelling my stock market based ETF purchases for April 1st.

        "title": "I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:",
        "text": "Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can\u2019t be brushed off.\n\nCoreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.\n\nWhen Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.\n*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*\n\nWhen Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?\n\nIn December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various \"unspecified\" actions and \"accidents\". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.\n*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*\n\nWildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The \"administrative accident\" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.\n\nThat same company, \"backed\" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.\n\nJust keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.\n\n**It's not rocket appliances**\n\n",

ANYTHING coming from these two will have a import duty charge of +25%.\n\ni couldnt find 2024 figures but gold imports in 2023:\n\n128.40 Tonnes from Canada ($6.84B) and 36.8 tonnes from Mexico ($1.18B)\n\nThat's 165.2 tonnes imported from these two countries and the total US consumption for 2024 was 200 tonnes.\n\nPer CNBC, More than 600 tons, or almost 20 million ounces of gold, has been transported into vaults in New York City since December last year. If retail, commercial and investment demand keeps up and the vaults start to run dry for delivery i think we see a huge spike in gold as demand outruns supply. Same situation with silver.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/us-gold-demand-is-sucking-bullion-out-of-other-countries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/us-gold-demand-is-sucking-bullion-out-of-other-countries.html)\n\nAs gold goes higher, who is the single largest gold holder in the world? The USA. Who has a big debt problem? The USA. I don't think a gold standard will ever come back but just floating the idea will generate alot of interest.\n\nAlso central banks are buying at record levels. Things are going to get interesting.\n\nIm long AGQ, i think silver has more upside.",

            "The idea of the tariffs and trade war - seemingly appear to be a self created event (Trump's team creating the event) that will last a few months - and then through negotiations - Trump lifts the tariffs and tries to sell it as he is the master of the deal - when in reality, he created the mess with the sole purpose of trying to use a solution to appear to be the person that solved the mess.",
            "As someone who shorted telsa and lost all of it over a weekend I can explain why in 5 reasons in order.\n\nA) Shorting the market is based on supply and demand.   If everyone is shorting a stock the cost to short the stock is already baked in.   If a stock is practically guaranteed to go down,  then it costs more to short - the odds of the stock going down is baked into the price.  Everyone has the same idea,  there isnt free money to be made.\n\nB) When a market is overly shorted - everyone is shorting a stock,  then the market will notice and those with the stocks just wont sell,  or like Tesla - actually coordinate and buy more stock,  thus destroying all the shorts and making a large profit off those gambling it will go down.  Even though the company itself has no value,  there is profit to be made manipulating the market.   Almost always its manipulated by the big players but at least one one occasion the public manipulated it with GameStop.  Think of it like non main stream crypto currencies - there is no actual value in it,  the value is ability to gamble with the coin in the market.  Volatility is value because you can manipulate it.   Professionals and insiders will use volatility to make money.\n\nC) No one wants to lose billions of dollars.   Think this scene in the big short:  [https://youtu.be/F3goSYkVPNE?si=beiiBHP9V0ea3PWf](https://youtu.be/F3goSYkVPNE?si=beiiBHP9V0ea3PWf) \\- even when banks figured out that their bond values were worthless - the value maintained its price - because the banks didnt let the price fall through various means.   They will continue to profit off maintaining a price until its physically impossible not to.  Even the public when a stock is tanking dont sell - because there is a sunken cost fallacy,  or they may even buy because \"its so cheap\" not gambling on the value of the company but just straight up gambling.  People dont want to take a 50% loss,  the value of a stock maintains its value because it has value - the underlying assets dont matter on stocks that never had any value to begin with.  Using Tesla as an example,  it was never worth as much as all car companies combined by any metric,  its value is based on people who want to make money.  Everyone jumps on the money train,  no one wants to get off.\n\nD) You as the general public cant time the Rug pull.   The general public doesnt have 24/7 stock brokers monitoring the market with all sorts of contracts,  preferred stock,  millisecond trades using stop losses.  These people will ensure that they are covered before the rug gets pulled out from under the public.   Privatize gains,  socialize losses.   Unless your an insider you cant time when this happens and you wont be covered when it does unless your a professional.   At any given time,  these companies can announce a new project ( Telsa's Fake electric airplane for example ) or add tariff that excludes Tesla ( stock goes up ) or oh nevermind tarriffs arent happening... oh wait they are!  You can get screwed anytime... guessing the rug pull is luck.\n\nE)  Options trading ( shorting / buying ) is high risk and low profit - seriously - youll risk 100% of your money for a chance to make 10% - 10% is a good sell or youll lose everything multiple times for the 1/10 chance to make 100% on higher risk bets.   This is why you see so many people who make 100k or an even a million dollars and then they lose everything the next week.   At any time the risk of loss can easily outweigh the profit - and as stated above you can get screwed for so many things out of your control.   Sometimes market manipulation - sometimes literally just an act of God,  a death of public figure,  a natural disaster,  a war.  Who knows."

            "I also want to make an important point here.\n\nEven if the car model is assembled in the US (example, the Ford Explorer), the raw materials and parts that go into it will be subjected to the tariff.\n\nThe automakers get their steel and aluminum from outside the US, they get the electronics outside of the US, they get the paint outside of the US, they get the silica sand for glass and casting outside of the US.\n\nThere is no way any car buyer will be able to avoid the effect of the tariffs. I repeat, there is no way any car buyer will be able to avoid the effect of the tariff. And on top of that, when a final assembled vehicle imported into the US becomes 25% more expensive, companies which assemble their particular models in the US, on top of the tariff increases on the materials and parts, will increase the price even further on top b/c now the competition will be more expensive.\n\nSimple math calculates that an Ontario-built base model RAV4, will now cost USD $40,000 at your local dealer. Besides the Ford Escape (assembled in Kentucky) increasing in price due to the cost of the tariffs on the materials and parts, Ford will add further price increases so they can be just a bit under the price of the RAV4. So a Ford Escape built in the US, should be -$10,000 cheaper than the tariffed RAV4, but instead Ford will increase their price by +$5,000 or more, blame it on the tariffs and advertise it still being cheaper than the RAV4.\n\nWinners: Ford and other companies whose models are made in the US. Their profits will soar, and they won't need to hire anyone extra to do so\n\nLosers: Everyone who buys vehicles.

        "text": "Nvidia, with its massive AI data-center business, is becoming increasingly caught in the middle of the trade war between China and the U.S., and it has the biggest business in China of the three companies. According to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, Nvidia\u2019s fiscal 2025 total revenue in China was about $17 billion, including data centers, automotive and networking. He estimates China data centers alone contributed about $12 billion.\n\nAs we know AI technology relies on GPU, some stocks like $BIDU, $AIFU, $MRVL, $TCEHY, $TSM may get influenced. \n\n\u201cChina is an important market,\u201d Rasgon told MarketWatch, but at its highest level, it\u2019s only been about 13% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. China contributes about 5% of the company\u2019s earnings per share, he added.",

            "Youre looking at it wrong imo. I think a lot of retail going to get burned on this same play. Everyone and their mother knows tariffs are coming on 4/2. The question is are they meaningfully more/less impactful than expected. There is a baseline impact that is priced into the market right now. This is an extremely hard question to answer and 99% of the regards on here have no clue. Even institutions largely have no clue. To answer this question you need to have a feel for A. what level of tariffs is priced in, and B. what level of tariffs will actually be implemented. Thinking you have a real grasp on either let alone both of those things is delusional for 99.99% of people.\n\nA lot of regards playing this same narrative \"tariff come 4/2. surely market dump\" - IMO there is a very real possibility we pump massively because tariffs could be more tame than what is priced in.

Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.\n\nAfter factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA\u2019s lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I\u2019m wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.\n\nI don\u2019t need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won\u2019t be impacted by AI restrictions\u2026\n\nWorst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years. Best case scenario for me is if the price remains in the 129 range and I will get to write puts again (6th time) and continue to collect premiums.\n\n",

        "title": "$AVXL - Alzheimer\u2019s Drug that Actually Works - Pending EMA Approval",
        "text": "\n1. Introduction to Blarcamesine\n\nBlarcamesine, also known as ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, is an investigational oral therapy developed by Anavex Life Sciences. It functions as an agonist of the sigma-1 (SIGMAR1) receptor and muscarinic receptors, aiming to restore cellular homeostasis disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n**Additional reading:** https://www.sotcanalytics.com/\n\n2. Clinical Trial Insights\n\nA pivotal Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial evaluated blarcamesine\u2019s efficacy in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients over 48 weeks. The results were promising:\n\t\u2022\tCognitive Benefits: Blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, indicating a notable preservation of cognitive function.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSafety Profile: The therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant neuroimaging adverse events reported.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSIGMAR1 Wild-Type Subgroup Analysis: In a prespecified analysis focusing on patients with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant), blarcamesine exhibited an even greater clinical benefit. These patients experienced a 49.8% reduction in clinical progression at 48 weeks on the primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. **This represents over 70% of the patient population.** \n\nThese results were published in a peer reviewed journal article over 50 doctors/researchers  representing 42 external organizations: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2274580724006083\n\n3. Market Potential\n\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutics market is poised for substantial growth:\n\t\u2022\tCurrent and Projected Market Size: Valued at approximately $4.05 billion in 2022, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.99%, reaching around $15.19 billion by 2030.\n\t\u2022\tValuation of Alzheimer\u2019s Drugs: An FDA-approved Alzheimer\u2019s drug can carry a market value of approximately $43.4 billion. For instance, Biogen\u2019s Aducanumab was valued at this figure upon approval. Similarly, drugs in Phase 3 trials, like Eli Lilly\u2019s Donanemab, have been valued around $20.2 billion, with potential increases upon receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation.\n\n**AVXL inexplicably has a market cap under $1B with over 25% of the float short**. If they even sniff the valuations argued here, we\u2019re looking at a triple digit share price. \n\nhttps://ipwatchdog.com/2021/10/26/assessing-much-alzheimers-drug-worth/id=139154/\n\n4. Investment Considerations\n\nInvestors should monitor:\n\t\u2022\tRegulatory Milestones: Blarcamesine has received EMA filing acceptance for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, marking a significant step toward potential market approval. **A decision should be made by the end of 2025** \n\n\t\u2022    Upcoming conference on April 5th which Anavex is expected to reveal additional subgroup analysis of their trial. \n\n5. Conclusion\n\nBlarcamesine represents a compelling candidate in the Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutics sector. Its innovative mechanism of action, coupled with favorable clinical trial results, positions it as a potential frontrunner in addressing a significant unmet medical need. Given the substantial market valuations observed with similar drugs, blarcamesine\u2019s successful development and approval could yield considerable financial returns.\n\nCorporate presentation: https://www.anavex.com/_files/ugd/79bcf7_da38b4e0ad4b4ff888363403e3962ef2.pdf\n\nP.S. - yes I know Martin Shkreli is short. Yes, I watched his \u201canalysis\u201d. Yes I know people will say it\u2019s SAVA 2.0. **Clearly I disagree based on my long position.**\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational purposes and should not be construed as financial advice.

Each claim form must be complete with the purchaser's full name & address (only 1 claim per purchaser is permitted under the program) and the registered VIN.

A 13% pump simply due to \"softer tariffs\" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.\n\nAt 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and \ud83e\udd6d cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them. \n\nElmo is planning something big and our PUTS will be fucked. \n\nI felt that one of us must address this problem and warn the others about Elmo.",

            "here's the full text :  \n  \nThey\u2019re at it again. \u201cMicroStrategy Incorporated d/b/a Strategy\u201d \u2014 the enterprise software company turned bitcoin maximalist \u2014 has announced a new financial instrument to raise money to buy more bitcoin. It\u2019s called Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock.\u00a0 \u201cStrife\u201d? \u201cPerpetual Strife\u201d? Matt Levine at Bloomberg had initially suspected a typo when he read it, but 23 references in the document suggest not. Maybe it\u2019s an inside joke \u2014 the kind of thing that sounds clever at 5am at an after-party. Or perhaps it\u2019s an unwittingly honest nod to the drama surrounding the company\u2019s relentless bitcoin accumulation. The bizarro name isn\u2019t the only head-scratcher. Strife comes with quirks that set it apart from Strategy\u2019s previous fundraising efforts. For one, it\u2019s not your typical (Micro)Strategy dilutive equity issuance; unlike the perpetual strike preferred securities (STRK), it is not convertible into common stock. Michael Saylor, executive chair, has pitched it as a way to tap into the vast pool of fixed-income investors who generally prefer stability and predictable returns. Yet Strife offers neither. It exposes investors to bitcoin\u2019s downside (since Strategy\u2019s creditworthiness hinges on its crypto holdings) without giving them any upside if the cryptocurrency soars. The dividend is fixed, so if bitcoin \u201cmoons\u201d, Strife holders are left watching from the sidelines. It\u2019s like being invited to an all-you-can-eat buffet but only allowed to smell the food. The dividend structure is another oddity. Unlike Strategy\u2019s STRK, where dividends could be paid in cash or stock at the company\u2019s discretion, Strife dividends are strictly cash-only. The instrument offers a 10 per cent annual payout, but there\u2019s a catch: if the company defers payment, the dividend rate increases by one per cent per year, capping at 18 per cent. Buried in the fine print of the prospectus is a crucial detail: the board can suspend dividends altogether. It\u2019s essentially a \u201ctrust me\u201d deal.\u00a0 \\[O\\]ur board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may choose not to pay accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock for any reason. Accordingly, we may pay less than the full amount of accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock. In addition, if we fail to declare and pay accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock in full, then the value of the perpetual strife preferred stock will likely decline. Investors can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned. And where is the cash for these dividends supposed to come from? According to recent filings, MicroStrategy has less than $50mn in cash, and its legacy software business is bleeding money. Servicing a 10 per cent yield on $500mn of preferred stock will require creative financing. The company apparently intends to fund the dividend not from operating cash flow like a normal company, but rather by selling more stock or other dilutive securities:\u00a0 We expect to fund any dividends paid in cash on the perpetual strife preferred stock primarily through additional capital raising activities, including, but not limited to, at-the-market offerings of our class A common stock and our perpetual strike preferred stock. Issuing equity to keep the peace on Strife would be highly dilutive, and that is on top of the dilution from the dividends on STRK. As for convertible bonds, the market already feels saturated with Strategy\u2019s equity-linked paper, and issuing more would simply add leverage to service a dividend lower in the capital stack.\u00a0 Still, Strategy has managed to assemble an impressive roster of underwriters, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, and Moelis, with Fidelity as a selling agent to retail investors. This suggests either investor enthusiasm for Saylor\u2019s bitcoin-centric vision \u2014 or, at the very least, an appreciation for the fees the company is willing to pay Wall Street. Strife is a fascinating \u2014 if baffling \u2014 addition to Strategy\u2019s playbook. It seems to defy financial logic, offering fixed-income investors an instrument with an unfavourably asymmetric return profile and piling on more dilution for common stockholders. But given the firm\u2019s all-in bet on crypto, perhaps \u201cPerpetual Strife\u201d is the perfect name. When you\u2019re staking everything on bitcoin, a little chaos is inevitable.",

        "title": "Thoughts on Quantum Computing - from a Physicist",
        "text": "*New post, now with screenshot.*\n\nMy background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\n**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).\n\n**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\n**IonQ**\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\n**Rigetti**\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.\n\n**QUBT**\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space. Someone please make a similar post about space to convince me that space is bad too so I'll finally put my money into VOO and QQQ.",

I believe I\u2019ll make a of minimum 2x off this investment.\n\nvalaris (val) is the largest offshore drilling contractor by fleet size, operating 53 rigs, including 18 floaters (13 drillships and 5 semisubmersibles) and 35 jackups. the company provides contract drilling services to major oil companies such as exxonmobil, chevron, bp, shell, petrobras, and equinor. following a downturn in the offshore drilling industry and a 2020 bankruptcy restructuring, valaris emerged with no long-term debt, a modernized fleet, and an improving financial position, allowing it to capitalize on the offshore drilling recovery.\n\noffshore drilling fundamentals are improving as the supply of rigs has tightened significantly. a decade ago, the global offshore fleet consisted of approximately 300 vessels, but that number has now dropped to around 150, with only 120-130 of them actively operational. meanwhile, demand for offshore drilling has rebounded, leading to a sharp increase in day rates, which are the prices oil companies pay to lease a drilling rig per day. since 2022, drillship day rates have doubled from around $250k per day to $500k per day. during the last cycle, they peaked at $800k per day, and current market conditions suggest they could reach $900k per day. offshore drilling has also become more cost-competitive, with breakeven prices of around $40 per barrel, compared to $60 per barrel for most u.s. shale projects.\n\nvalaris has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry. unlike competitors such as transocean, which is burdened with over $6.5 billion in debt, valaris currently operates with minimal net debt relative to industry peers, giving it a major advantage in capital allocation and flexibility. despite its strong position, the company remains deeply undervalued. with an enterprise value of approximately $5.1 billion compared to an estimated $30 billion replacement cost for its fleet, valaris is currently trading at just 16 cents on the dollar relative to its assets. management has been actively repurchasing shares, reducing the share count by around 5% since 2021, and the company maintains a buyback yield of approximately 5%, further enhancing shareholder value.\n\nvaluation metrics further support the investment case. based on projected fcf, valaris is trading at a p/fcf of about 10x for 2025 and 4x for 2026. ev/ebitda ratio stands at around 5x for 2025 and is expected to drop to 3x in 2026, whereas industry peers typically trade at 8-10x. net asset value analysis suggests a target enterprise value of around $27 billion, implying a potential 7x upside from current levels.\n\nif drillship day rates continue their upward trajectory and approach $900k per day, applying a peak-cycle nav multiple of 1.5x would imply an enterprise value of approximately $27 billion, which translates to a share price of around $500, representing a 10x return from current levels. in a more conservative scenario where day rates stabilize between $600k and $700k per day, a 1.25x nav multiple would still yield an enterprise value of $18 billion to $22 billion, implying a share price in the range of $250 to $350, or a 5-7x return. even in a bearish case where day rates hold at $500k per day, applying a 1.0x nav multiple would still result in an enterprise value of $14 billion to $18 billion, meaning the stock could reach $150 to $200 per share, offering a 2-3x return from current levels.\n\nthere are risks to consider, such as oil price volatility, which could affect offshore drilling demand. however, offshore projects now have lower breakevens than shale, making them more resilient to price fluctuations. execution risk is another factor, as management must continue optimizing capital allocation and fleet utilization. additionally, the market may take time to recognize the disconnect between valaris\u2019s asset value and its current share price.\n\ndespite these risks, valaris presents one of the most compelling deep-value opportunities in the market. it is trading well below its asset value while benefiting from rising day rates, improving financials, and aggressive share buybacks. in a conservative scenario, the stock has 2-3x upside, while in a more bullish offshore drilling cycle, it could rise 5-10x from current levels. with strong industry tailwinds and a clean balance sheet, valaris offers an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity that is rare in today\u2019s market.\n\ni believe offshore drilling is the best investment opportunity over the next couple years and im all in.",

Strong cash position.\n\n# Addressing the Impact of the Semaglutide Shortage Ending\n\nOn\u00a0February 21, 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over. This was big news for Hims & Hers, as it came just days before their earnings call. While the timing was unexpected, it ultimately worked in HIMS\u2019 favor, allowing management to adjust guidance and directly answer difficult questions on the call.\n\n**What Was the Semaglutide Shortage, and Why Does It Matter?**\n\nPharmaceutical companies are incentivized through patents, which grants them exclusive rights to sell patented drugs and recoup the costs of research and development. For example, Novo Nordisk holds the patent for Ozempic (semaglutide) until 2031. However, if the drug is in high demand and the company is unable to meet supply, the FDA can declare a shortage. This allows generic compounded versions of the drug to be sold by other companies, even while under patent protection. This allows companies like HIMS to sell their own generic GLP-1 to help meet the demand of the drug during a supply shortage.\n\nWith Novo Nordisk now claiming they can meet demand; the FDA has removed semaglutide from the shortage list. As a result, companies like HIMS can no longer sell compounded generics commercially.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a legal loophole:\n\n* Semaglutide is commercially available in fixed doses (0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg, and 2.4mg).\n* If a specific prescribed dose is unavailable, it can still be compounded and sold.\n\nSince HIMS specializes in personalization, many of its GLP-1 prescriptions are in personalized, custom dosages. HIMS has committed to continuing to provide these dosages where clinically necessary.\n\nCEO Andrew Dudum has made it clear that while HIMS can no longer sell commercial dosages of GLP-1, that they will continue providing personalized prescriptions where clinically necessary.\n\nOn the earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized this point: ***\u201cWhat we see in general in our platform is, as Andrew mentioned, many of the folks that are coming to our platform have come and have had struggles with GLP-1s in the past. That was the genesis behind one of the reasons behind why we very quickly looked to roll out the personalized dosages as well.****\"*\n\nHe also noted that \u201ca majority of individuals on the platform today are utilizing personalized dosages versus the commercially available dosages.\u201d\n\n**Example of HIMS GLP-1 Onboarding Regimen:**\u00a0Note the customized dosages.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us2f3qls1oqe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cc45df6496f7af09aaa3d41c9fe77081842837\n\n# The Financial Impact of GLP-1\n\nMy prior estimate for GLP-1 Revenue as of Q3 2024 was 10-15% of total revenue. The company has now confirmed $225 million in GLP-1 revenue for 2024, approximately 15% of total FY24 revenue.\n\n*Subscriber growth and revenue growth existed prior to GLP-1 announcements and offerings at HIMS.* HIMS has been a disruptive and rapidly growing company before introducing GLP-1 into the equation.\n\nOf note: GLP-1 was primarily a revenue and subscriber driver in the short term with compressed margins due to initial investment costs. The company has made it clear that economies of scale take time for new product lines.\n\n**Gross Margin Compression from 82% to 79.45% YoY.**\u00a0Expected per HIMS due to GLP-1.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uev7s8sv1oqe1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bc59ed9a5dfccd2c7cea498c132351bb751368\n\nI believe that GLP-1 \u2018hype\u2019 certainly fueled much of the recent stock craze surrounding HIMS but it was not, and has not been, a core tenet of my thesis for the investment. HIMS is well-positioned to adapt, already planning to:\n\n* Continue offering personalized GLP-1 dosages.\n* Bring back commercial GLP-1\u00a0with any new shortage.\n* Expand its weight loss portfolio, emphasizing its\u00a0oral weight loss medications\u00a0(already generating\u00a0$100M+ in revenue\u00a0within seven months of launch).\n* Introduce liraglutide\u00a0as an alternative weight loss treatment in 2025.\n\nWhile there will be customers that leave HIMS, many customers who initially joined for GLP-1 are expected to transition to other offerings.\n\n# Debunking the \u201cNo Moat\u201d Argument\n\nI disagree with the idea that HIMS lacks a competitive moat\u2026\n\n# Brand & Marketing Moat\n\nWhile I have been aware of HIMS since IPO, it first caught my attention as an investment opportunity due to its standout marketing strategy. HIMS has executed on a marketing strategy that has created a strong, trusted brand. Simply put, HIMS makes Erectile Dysfunction medicine \u201ccool\u201d rather than clinical or embarrassing.\n\nHIMS has positioned itself with a first mover advantage in the personalized healthcare and wellness industry. Its focus on:\n\n* Personalized treatments\n* Combination medications\n* Direct-to-consumer accessibility\n\n\u2026makes it a unique player in the telehealth space.\n\n# Convenience & Consumer Experience\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is a nightmare for many - complicated, expensive, and frustrating. Long wait times, insurance headaches, and unclear pricing leave patients feeling powerless. HIMS provides an alternative with a consumer-first approach that eliminates these barriers.\n\n* Accessibility \u2013 No waiting rooms. No insurance approvals. Just frictionless, direct-to-consumer care.\n* Discretion \u2013 Patients can access treatments privately and comfortably.\n* Transparent Pricing \u2013 Consumers know exactly what they\u2019re paying before they commit.\n\nUnlike traditional healthcare, where patients feel like passive participants, HIMS allows consumers to take control of their health.\n\nThe out-of-pocket cost of care continues to rise, with more Americans opting for high-deductible plans. As co-pays and other expenses grow faster than inflation, affordability is an increasing concern. HIMS is well-positioned within this cash-pay segment, offering upfront pricing and a premium experience.\n\nFrom discreet online consultations to direct-to-door delivery, HIMS is designed for convenience. Consumers can browse treatments, receive personalized recommendations, and have medications shipped - all from their phone or computer. This retail-like approach makes healthcare as simple as shopping online, removing the stigma and complexity that often deter people from seeking treatment.\n\nUnlike traditional telehealth models that feel transactional and impersonal, HIMS created a premium consumer engagement. Rather than passively following doctor\u2019s orders, users customize their care, select treatments, and interact with a brand that prioritizes them.\n\nIn a world where convenience, transparency, and trust drive consumer decisions, HIMS offers a modern and approachable healthcare experience, a key differentiator.\n\nI believe HIMS has and is continuing to grow their brand moat as a trusted, transparent, premium, personalized health and wellness provider that brings a consumer experience to the healthcare system.\n\n# Regarding Share Dilution: A Manageable Concern\n\nHIMS has been diluting shares at about 8% per year, which isn\u2019t ideal. It is important to understand that HIMS is a young, high-growth company that is utilizing Share Based Compensation to attract, retain, and incentivize talent. Free cash flow growth is rapidly outpacing share-based compensation. I believe the impact of Shared Based Compensation to be reasonable and manageable and will minimize over time.\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/gs1g69sz1oqe1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd85d1e0b100862e5900d7d616544d3c0d2c14f)\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/a4jetk112oqe1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=794186a27687540216913ae098d66024a4284234)\n\n# 2025 Outlook:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7tpgw242oqe1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=2512ebd9e99316590d7c4134fe30f9507bce8592\n\n# Growth Opportunities & Catalysts\n\n* **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 100M+ Americans suffer from weight-related health problems.\n* **New Categories:** HIMS plans to launch 1-2 major new categories annually. Of focus with new acquisitions: low testosterone, menopause support, and peptides.\n* **At-Home Lab Testing:** New service offering that will support fricitionless access to hormonal treatment via HIMS while expanding personalized, data-driven care. Paired with MedMatch, HIMS' AI-driven treatment-matching service, at-home lab testing enhances the ability to identify additional products for consumer benefit. Utilizing data to personalize the consumer experience, increasing offerings and awareness of appropriate products based on data driven needs may lead to increased cross selling.\n* **Subscription Growth:** CEO Andrew Dudum aims for 10M subscribers, a realistic target based on historical trends. On the earnings call, Dudum noted: ***\"I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.\"***\n\nIn addition, average revenue per subscriber is becoming a larger driver of revenue growth: ***\"While the addition of subscribers remains the primary component of our growth, monthly online average revenue per subscriber is becoming a more meaningful contributor as well. Monthly online average revenue per subscriber increased 38% year-over-year to $73 in the fourth quarter.\"***\n\nThis is a positive long-term trend, though the recent spike was undoubtedly impacted by the sales of higher-priced GLP-1 products.\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/689lrlqc2oqe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=53e2ef0e32bf3061e65ef8c5dcc520a33fe9943a)\n\n# Risks & Challenges\n\n* **Regulatory Risk:** As always, there are regulatory risks for healthcare companies (and opportunities - i.e. favorable changes to compounding regulations).\n* **GLP-1 Competition:** Commercial semaglutide providers are working hard to limit access to compounded GLP-1. In addition, a direct-to-consumer cash option for Wegovy has been released but remains more than 2x the cost of HIMS offering. (Again, I see GLP-1 as a bonus here, not a core tenet of the HIMS thesis.)\n* **Execution Risk:** The recent FDA ruling on GLP-1 has put HIMS under increased scrutiny. Fortunately, the decision came before earnings, allowing the company to adjust its guidance and answer questions. Despite this, HIMS maintained a strong outlook, reflecting confidence in its execution of weight-loss products. While I\u2019ve never viewed HIMS as purely a GLP-1 investment, it will be important to see how their estimations of personalized GLP-1 offerings and transition to aliterate weight loss products delivers.\n\n# Valuation:\n\nKeep in mind that all of my calculations are estimates, intended to provide general guidelines for my personal decision-making.\n\n# Multiple Valuation: Price/Sales\n\nDuring the Q4 2024 earnings call, HIMS CEO Andrew Dudum reiterated confidence in the company\u2019s long-term growth trajectory, stating that the goal of reaching 10 million subscribers was well within reach: **\"I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.\"**\n\nWith this target in mind, let\u2019s assess a potential share price through the lens of the Price-to-Sales ratio, using Dudum\u2019s stated goal alongside Monthly Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPU).\n\nIn Q4 2024, HIMS reported a Monthly ARPU of $73. However, this figure was temporarily elevated by GLP-1 prescriptions. A more balanced estimate comes from the full-year 2024 average, which stood at $63 per subscriber per month. We\u2019ll use this more conservative metric for our valuation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdm1kbwj2oqe1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3923e95d8bedf34b3836b81ac5250bd6acf01ed\n\n**Bullish/CEO scenario: By 2031, with 10 million subscribers generating $63 in monthly revenue per user:**\n\n***Implied 2031 Price Range:***\u00a0*$102.62 - $205.25.

I first invested after its initial quarter of profitability, starting at $12 and averaging up to $15.89 before Q4 earnings. Prior to Q4 earning, I felt a FV of HIMS was around $57 and was comfortable purchasing below $45. Following the post-earnings dip, I added in the mid-$30s, bringing my cost basis to $27.10.\n\nDespite concerns over GLP-1, I see the reaction as overblown. My long-term conviction remains intact, and I continue to believe in 10x+ potential over the next decade.\n\nCurrently, HIMS is at my target portfolio weighting, but I\u2019d consider adding more if the stock remains in the low-$30s to high-$20s. Based on a 20% margin of safety using a 25% free cash flow growth rate discounted at 10%, I view $46.64 and below as an attractive price. Purchasing in the low-$30s aligns with the more cautious 6 million subscriber scenario.\n\nHIMS isn\u2019t just a GLP-1 stock\u2014it\u2019s a disruptive healthcare brand. The business continues to scale, expand, and differentiate itself, making it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.\n\n# Position:\n\n**Doubling down this week if we remain in mid-30s.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcqmptdn6oqe1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d82ca9738d9e9e82db87fa6c89a1f2c6fc3027d",

        "title": "HUYA - 41% Yield - WSB DD!",
        "text": "Time for some good old fashioned DD! \n\nHUYA is the ultimate buy of 2025, let me tell you why. \n\nFirst off, China stocks are soaring, nearly every major institution is going long China. HUYA is best of class, owned by Tencent, the management team is all Tencent, one of the best operators in China and here\u2019s the kicker .. HUYA has NO DEBT and $900 Million in cash, current market cap 750M .. YES, you read that correct they are trading for less than their CASH balance. It makes NO sense, and I believe it will be corrected quickly. \n\nHUYA just announced MAJOR news - they are retuning 50% of their market cap back to investors in COLD HARD CASH. HUYA is paying a $1.47 cent dividend in July. That is a 41% dividend yield ! The stock is currently $3.25 per share. Buying now will give you a cost avg around $1.80 for a Tencent Backed growing company. Very few times in life will you find a 40% yield on your cash, this is one of them. \n\nMore news, they are buying back $100M worth of stock. They bought $1M worth of their own shares in ONE DAY and The CEO made an announcement, \u201cwe feel the stock price does not accurately reflect the business or future of the company.\u201d For those that follow China stocks, BABA made an almost identical statement around $72 per share, now look at BABA (up 100% from that announcement) \n\nNext; PATTERNS \u2026. Last year HUYA announced a large dividend of $1.07 - over the following month the stock climbed the entire amount of the dividend plus much more. People, institutions, etc will pour into this company to lock in that massive 40% divided. I expect the stock to climb at least the amount of dividend plus some before July. \n\nFor every 10,000 shares of HUYA you own, you are making $14,700 in cash payment just this year. In my opinion this stock should return to $6.50 before dividend - meaning 100% gains, plus 40% dividend yield. \n\nHUYA is the best stock in the market at this moment. \n\nPosition: LONG 41,000 shares, with plans to buy much more on any dip.

        "text": "1. **Markets Are Rallying - But Don\u2019t Let That Fool You** Hey! Happy Monday. Yes, stocks are flying higher today. The Dow jumped almost 400 points before the open. And yes, the mood on Wall Street is suddenly\u2026 cheerful. **But don\u2019t get too comfortable.** Because under the surface, nothing has actually changed. The reason for this bounce? Trump. Tariffs. And a little dose of wishful thinking.\n2. **Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s really happening** Over the weekend, *Bloomberg* and *The Wall Street Journal* dropped some reports that lit a fire under the market. Here\u2019s what they said:So now, the narrative is: \u201cMaybe the tariffs won\u2019t be that bad after all.\u201d And just like that, **risk is back on**. **Wall Street\u2019s playing a dangerous game here** Make no mistake - **the tariffs are still coming**. That part hasn\u2019t changed. The only thing that\u2019s shifted is the tone. It\u2019s softer. A bit more \u201cflexible.\u201d But structurally Trump\u2019s whole economic plan is still about dismantling globalization, forcing production back into the U.S., and making imported goods more expensive. That *will* hit supply chains. Especially the ones that depend on semi-finished goods moving back and forth across borders. And that\u2019s what\u2019s making investors uneasy - even as the market rallies.1\n   * Trump\u2019s planned *reciprocal tariffs* \\- which are set to be announced April 2 - may not be as brutal as people feared.\n   * There could be **exceptions for certain countries**.\n   * They may not directly target specific industries like autos, semiconductors, and pharma after all.\n   * And Trump hasn\u2019t reacted to the leaks yet - which is giving investors a strange kind of hope.\n3. **Here\u2019s what\u2019s adding fuel to the fire this week**Put all that together, and you\u2019ve got a technical rally. **But it\u2019s not about confidence in the economy.** It\u2019s just positioning, timing, and a bit of blind optimism. **What about earnings?** It\u2019s a quiet week.Economic data... same story.\n4. So overall, **no major landmines this week**, and that\u2019s helping keep the risk-on mood alive.11\n   1. **Seasonal flows**: Historically, from late March through mid-April, capital flows tend to support U.S. equities. It\u2019s been that way since 1928. Nothing magical - just calendar-based inflows.\n   2. **Pension buying**: Goldman Sachs estimates pension funds will buy around **$29 billion in U.S. stocks** this week as they rebalance at the end of Q1.\n   3. **CTAs (trend-following funds)** are switching: These quant-driven funds were heavily short. Now their models are flipping neutral or bullish - adding more buying pressure across the board.\n   * Tonight: KB Home reports after the close.\n   * Later this week: Dollar Tree, Paychex, Jefferies, Lululemon - a few names, but no heavy hitters.\n   * Nothing that\u2019s likely to shake the market.\n   * Today we got flash PMIs. Manufacturing ticked up a bit (52.7), services slightly weaker (51.2). Nothing shocking.\n   * Friday brings the PCE inflation data - the Fed\u2019s favorite gauge - but expectations are muted.\n5. **Meanwhile, China is making moves too** According to *The Wall Street Journal*, China is considering **export restrictions** aimed at the U.S. That\u2019s a signal: they\u2019re trying to ease tensions, maybe offer a trade olive branch ahead of the April 2 announcements. There\u2019s also talk of a Trump-Xi conversation in April - possibly a symbolic birthday summit (they were born a day apart). That could help dial things down. Or not. **Let\u2019s zoom out for a second** This rally is happening in the middle of a much bigger shift:You couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they\u2019ve said openly, **a recession is \u201cworth it\u201d** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.\n   * **Foreign investors are pulling money out of U.S. stocks.**\n   * The **Dow-to-Gold ratio** is starting to break down - a pattern that tends to show up before major crises.\n   * Corporate earnings **are falling**, even as prices climb. \n   * You couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they\u2019ve said openly, **a recession is \u201cworth it\u201d** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.\n\n1. It\u2019s not strength. It\u2019s a relief bounce.All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**\n   * The tariff threat *isn\u2019t gone*, just temporarily softened.\n   * Seasonality and positioning are doing the heavy lifting.\n   * But the deeper risks - falling earnings, policy instability, deglobalization - haven\u2019t gone anywhere.\n\nAll it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**",

Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.\n\nBy comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.\n\nChinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.\n\nBYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK),\u00a0[BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV),\u00a0[9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.\n\nBEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK),\u00a0[GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.\n\nTotal car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.",

            "[https://archive.is/69dLB](https://archive.is/69dLB)\n\nA manager of a $3.4 billion Chinese equity fund that\u2019s outperformed virtually all of its peers in 2025 expects a turnaround in consumer confidence will further boost domestic shares.\n\nCashed-up households and Beijing\u2019s pledge to support consumption should propel stocks even higher once sentiment picks up, according to Fidelity International\u2019s Hyomi Jie. Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and sportswear maker Anta Sports Products Ltd. are among top holdings in her Fidelity Funds - China Consumer Fund, which has beaten 99% of its peers this year with a 16% return.\n\nAnemic consumer spending in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy has been largely driven by weak sentiment, rather than a lack of funds, so \u201cwhen consumer confidence improves, spending will increase and support the overall sentiment toward broader Chinese markets,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the nation\u2019s shares have outpaced most regional peers in 2025 thanks to a DeepSeek-fueled surge in tech stocks, more sectors are starting to participate in the rally. The MSCI China sub-index of consumer discretionary shares is the second-best performing sectoral gauge next to its tech counterpart, jumping about 27% this year.\n\nThe equity market\u2019s gains also coincide with Beijing\u2019s efforts to ramp up consumption. With a volley of subsidies and elevated household savings, more people appear ready to open their wallets. The improving outlook for consumers is already showing up in data, with retail sales growth picking up more than forecast in the first two months of the year.\n\nJie, who\u2019s based in Singapore, is especially bullish on China\u2019s sportswear industry and has been investing in Anta since taking over the portfolio in 2020. The stock is up 11% this year.\n\n\u201cThe sportswear industry in China is one of the largest and fastest growing in the world, driven by the presence of a large millennial population, and increasing focus on healthy lifestyles,\u201d she said. The company is well-positioned to gain from its \u201cstrategy to develop different brands to satisfy different demands\u201d at various price points.\n\nShe also owns shares of Temu parent PDD Holdings Inc. and gaming company NetEase Inc. While the fund has outrun rivals in 2025, it isn\u2019t performing as well on a three- to five-year basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMore than a quarter of her fund\u2019s holdings are artificial intelligence infrastructure names, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Baidu Inc. Jie said they\u2019re key beneficiaries of the recent AI development spurred by DeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective model.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough was born of constraint,\u201d she said. \u201cThe efficiency gains are very significant and will extend across multiple sectors.\u201d",

        "text": "**TLDR: Aug 15'25 $TUR $30 Put Market to Open tomorrow morning if trading allowed and here's why:**\n\n* Political unrest amid jailing political opponents\n* Just today opposing party leaders announced widespread boycotts - 50m+ people total cohort size\n* Turkey's current financial system is flawed, they rely on high interest government bond sales to finance USD-TRY imbalance \n\n1.\u00a0**Analysis of Current Reserves:**\n\n* As of March 2025, Turkey\u2019s total (gross) foreign exchange reserves are approximately\u00a0**$85 billion**.\n* However, most of these reserves consist of swap agreements and external debts; the actual (net) reserves are likely close to zero or even negative.\n* The truly available (liquid) reserves for rapid intervention are, at best, around\u00a0**$20\u201340 billion**.\n\n2.\u00a0**Activities That Could Rapidly Erode Reserves and Their Effects (Data Supported):**\n\nThe following scenarios could rapidly deplete the reserves in the short term:\n\n**Mass Bond Sales and Foreign Exchange Purchases**\n\n* If 30 million people convert an average of\u00a0**$500**\u00a0per person from TRY to USD, it would result in a reserve loss of\u00a0**$15 billion**\u00a0in a short time.\n* *(30 million people \u00d7 $500 = $15 billion)*\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Mass Withdrawal of Deposits from Banks (Bank Panic)**\n\n* The total deposits in the Turkish banking system amount to approximately\u00a0**$450 billion**.\n* Even if only\u00a0**5%**\u00a0of these deposits are withdrawn in a panic (about\u00a0**$22.5 billion**), it could deplete more than half of the reserves in one go.\n\n**Tax Payment Refusals and Consumer Boycotts**\n\n* Turkey\u2019s annual tax revenue is approximately\u00a0**$150 billion**\u00a0(2024 budget).\n* Even a short-term\u00a0**20%**\u00a0tax boycott (a loss of about\u00a0**$2.5 billion per month**) would create a serious budget deficit within a few months.\n\n**Boycotts of Critical Sectors such as Energy and Transportation**\n\n* Turkey\u2019s monthly energy imports average about\u00a0**$5 billion**.\n* Even an extra crisis cost of\u00a0**20%**\u00a0in this area could result in an additional monthly reserve loss of\u00a0**$1 billion**.\n\n**Widespread Labor Strikes**\n\n* A general strike lasting just one week in Turkey would cost approximately\u00a0**$4\u20135 billion**.\n* Strikes lasting several weeks could rapidly deplete the reserves.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0**Total estimated short-term reserve loss (within one month):**\n\nIt could be around\u00a0**$20\u201340 billion**, which is nearly equivalent to all of Turkey\u2019s actual liquid reserves.\n\n3.\u00a0**Timeline Scenarios for Collapse (Supported by Figures):**\n\n\ud83d\udd34\u00a0**Aggressive Scenario (Full Bank Attack and Demand for Foreign Exchange):**\n\n* If\u00a0**10%**\u00a0of bank deposits are withdrawn, it would create a cash need of about\u00a0**$45 billion**.\n* The current liquid reserves (assumed to be around\u00a0**$30 billion**) would not be able to meet this demand.\n* The economy and banking sector could collapse within\u00a0**7\u201314 days**.\n\n\ud83d\udfe0\u00a0**Moderate Scenario (Partial Capital Outflow and Consumer Boycotts):**\n\n* Demand for foreign exchange, tax losses, and reduced consumption would push the monthly reserve loss to around\u00a0**$5\u201310 billion**.\n* The existing reserves could be depleted in about\u00a0**2\u20133 months**, bringing the economic crisis to a critical point.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1\u00a0**Controlled Scenario (Strict Capital Controls and External Financial Support):**\n\n* Capital outflows could be limited to\u00a0**$1\u20132 billion per month**.\n* With IMF or external support (for example,\u00a0**$10\u201315 billion**), the endurance of reserves could be extended to\u00a0**6\u201312 months**.\n\nI think this will lead to a government shutdown or change of power in the end. I don't see a humane way current government regaining back control without going bankrupt. If they do, it will be through terrorizing their own people and hijacking their bank accounts and other assets. If you make money out of this, I will suggest you sell when you see decent profits and buy yourself something nice. Be quick to exit this one.\n\nEDIT: Turkey just BANNED short selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange for one month.\n\nWhen short selling is banned, you know that BIG TROUBLES are always right around the corner.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nUPDATE: Turkey used a stunning $27BN in reserves to stabilize FX. Given recent reserve losses (USD 27bn), there is already large-scale short-term damage. I would sell TRY fiat for BTC now...",

        "text": "This is a weird post to write because half the people reading it are going to respond with *no fucking shit* but I'm seeing everyone from random WSB shitposters to fancy-pants investment bankers saying we've found the bottom so let's fucking do this.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) currently has a -1.8% annualized decline in real GDP for Q1 2025. What does that mean? Well, the [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession) will tell you that \"the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth is not an official designation\" and \"the designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)\"\u2014but that two quarters of negative GDP growth definition is pretty useful in practice. One quarter of economic contraction can be quickly forgotten, but two is generally a sign something is seriously wrong.\n\nA -1.8% annualized decline in one quarter is only like a -0.45% actual decline, but be honest with yourself: does it look like we're fucking done? GDPNow's methodology is similar to the BEA's except that instead of waiting for all the data to come in they update it continuously as new data is released. That does mean the decline could shrink as more data comes in\u2014but it also means the inputs are all stuff that's already actually happened, stuff like \"construction spending\" and \"retail sales\". It doesn't even try to model the effects of leading indicators like [collapsing consumer sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-survey-drops-in-march-to-57point9-worse-than-expected.html), much less predict the future effects of policy changes.\n\nSo let's talk about those policy changes, starting with tariffs, since those have been getting a lot of attention. We seem to be at the stage where people who want to believe everything's going to be OK are combing through Trump's statements for whatever scraps of reassurance they can find, which they can do because of Trump's tendency to speak in word-salad and promise everything to everyone.\n\nFor example, here's an [answer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html) he gave  on Friday to a question in an Oval Office press conference (transcription mine):\n\n>People are coming to me and talking about tariffs and a lot of people are asking me if they can have exceptions, and once you do that for one you have to do that for all, so I mean generally, I did something interestingly during two weeks ago, I gave the American car companies a break because it would've been unfair if I didn't and everybody said \"oh he changed his mind on tariffs!\" I didn't change my mind I helped our, you know, sort of big three, big four, I helped some of the American companies and instead of taking it properly they said \"oh he changed his\u2014\" I don't change, but the world \"flexibility\"'s an important word, sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal so that if China's charging us 50% or 30% or 20%, and I don't mean China I mean anybody, any country, Canada, nobody knows that Canada's charging our dairy farmers, they have 270% tariffs, nobody knows that, nobody knows that, they have up to 400%, they have a couple of tariffs, at 400%, nobody knows that, nobody talks about that.\n\nHe then went off on an extended tangent about why Canada should be a US state before ending by reiterating that \"nobody knows that they were getting 270% tariffs on dairy products\". And people have, in apparent seriousness, cited this answer as a reason for optimism, because he said there will be flexibility! Beyond the obvious rebuttals, it should be noted that the example he gave of \"flexibility\" was a [one-month pause](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-lutnick-2b269614084027a4894aa14f3dc16227), meaning tariffs are still coming for U.S. automakers.\n\nThe economic effects of mass-firings, along with cancelling leases and other contracts, don't get discussed as much. But they'll likely be quite serious. Mass-firings of federal workers could have an apocalyptic effect on the economies of Virginia and Maryland, effects by no means limits to the public sector, because those public sector employees are going to have to cut their spending at countless private businesses. Similarly, cancellation of leases threatens to crash real estate markets.\n\nAnd while the many of the effects may be concentrated in the DC metro area, there are major government offices spread throughout the country, so the mass-firings and lease cancellations will create little pockets of economic pain everywhere. Some effects may even be concentrated in rural areas\u2014like the effects of [cancelling contracts to buy food from American farmers to distribute as food aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311663/farmers-will-be-hit-hard-by-the-dismantling-of-usaid).\n\nThen there's the fact that many of the fired federal workers were actually doing stuff that's really important for the US economy to functions. Firing FAA workers threatens to hurt airlines and domestic tourism. Firing people at the CDC makes it harder to fight bird flu, which is bad not just for the egg industry but also beef and dairy. And so on.\n\nFinally there's Trump's immigration policies, whose effects range from farm workers being afraid to show up for work to completely fucking international tourism because apparently multi-week detentions of random tourists from [Europe](https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34) and [Canada](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney) is a thing we're doing now. Recently there was a forecast of a [5% decline in international tourism](https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/foreign-tourism-us-forecast-trump-tariffs-trade-war-russia-ukraine-war/) which under the circumstances actually strikes me as optimistic.\n\nI suspect the main reason a lot of people resist seeing what's staring them in the face is that during Trump's first administration the economy did okay until COVID hit. \"Util COVID hit\" is a pretty big caveat, especially with RFK Jr. running HHS, but never mind that. The bigger issue is that during his first term, there were still people in both the Republican congressional caucuses and his own administration willing to tell Trump \"no\". We don't seem to have that anymore, unless you count X \u00c6 A-12 telling him to \"shush\".\n\nSo TLDR; all signs point to us already having experienced an economic contraction in Q1 2025, and there's every reason to expect it to continue into Q2 and beyond. A recession, in other words. Of course, the question we all want to know on WallStreetBets is what this means for the stock market.\n\nFaithful believers in the efficient market hypothesis will insist everything I've described and more is already \"priced in\", to which I say: LOL. So far the S&P 500 has fallen 10% peak to trough, but a 10% drop is a fucking sneeze by stock market standards. I remember back in 2015 when my boss told me he was selling all his stocks because of some bullshit with China. I *didn't* sell because I didn't want to be the guy who sold at the bottom, but by the time the 2015-2016 selloff was over the S&P 500 was down 14%\u2014over fucking *nothing*.\n\nAn actual recession probably means a much more severe decline in stock prices. If I believed Trump administration messaging about [\"temporary pain\"](https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-officials-acknowledge-temporary-pain-amid-tariffs-and-market-unease/article_0186aba5-768e-572d-be2f-e9f2ef31ecbf.html), the precedent I'd be looking at is Paul Volker more or less causing a recession on purpose to fight inflation, which involved a 27% decline in the S&P 500. But Trump and Musk aren't Paul fucking Volker, so I'm expecting a greater than 30% decline.\n\nHow much more than 30%? Beats me, but assuming a decline of 31.5% decline from SPY's $612.93 peak yields a nice, easy-to-remember target price of $420. It could easily go even lower, but will almost certainly bounce back, and a lot of people aren't going to want to miss the recovery. Therefore, I wouldn't feel too stupid going long SPY at $420. At its current price, though, count me out.\n\nSo what do you do about it? Full-porting SPY 12/31 430p is obviously insanely risky. And unfortunately, given the range of tail-risks we're facing\u2014the debt ceiling, Trump deciding to actually act on [previous comments that much US government debt might be fraudulent](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud), or even fucking with the banking system\u2014I don't think any position is entirely safe. That said, here's what I've currently got.  \"Other\" stocks is GLD, domestic bonds are overwhelmingly TIPS:",

        "text": "So I have been thinking. What if the selling of all overvalued stocks and basically shit to retail the smartes move for Big Institutions? 2008 happened because institutions tried to sell each other the hot potato quickly devaluating everything until one got stuck with a huge pile of shit and had to go bankrupt and the rest had to be saved by the government and its taxpayers.\n\nWhat if they learned from it (smth very unlike but there is a small chance they did) and decided the best way to go is to animate the retailers to buy a big chunk of that shit so that on their books they only hold a small part of it and the loses are mainly eaten up by retail?\n\nI know this sounds weird because either way retail gets fucked but in this option no institution has to go bankrupt or have to receive hate from general population since they can simply say: hey guys you decided to invest in smth that is highly speculative you lost it on your own, but look at us since we are pros at this we didn\u2019t loose as much. \nUnlike if they would loose it it would be more of a: hey guys we tried reaching for the sun and got burned in the process. \n\nWhich in turn would explain the massive push for alternative trading platforms such as Robinhood and other online retail options.

Those who miss payments are cut off from deferring more, a practice that leaves 99% of its lending repaid, it said. Its average user owes the company $100.\n\nI have a feeling the average loan owed to Klarna will increase once this becomes active on DoorDash.

Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.\n\n**Robinhood's response:** The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process.  There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures.

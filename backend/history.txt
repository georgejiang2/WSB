Alright alright alright, heard there's some hype trains rollin'. Lemme hear the DD, you crayon-eatin' degenerates.

So what are we pumpin' and dumpin' today? Lay it on me thick. I need something to YOLO into before my wife leaves me and my kids start callin' my boyfriend daddy.

Don't gimme that boomer stock bullshit either. I need MOON SHOTS. I'm talkin' GME levels of retardation.

I'm all ears (and wallets) for the next big play... unless it's some garbage my boomer dad told me about. Then I'm out.
